# Compiler-based-Optimization-for-Machine-Learning-Models-on-Heterogeneous-Multi-Core-Systems
## Overview
This project presents a compiler-based optimization technique for machine learning models on heterogeneous multi-core systems. The goal is to unlock the full potential of ML models by improving performance, increasing throughput, and reducing latency while maintaining power efficiency.

## Features
* Optimized performance for ML models on heterogeneous multi-core systems
* Increased throughput and reduced latency
* Power efficiency to extend battery life
* Advanced compiler-based optimization techniques such as quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation

## Technical Details
Our compiler-based optimization technique employs the following methods:
* **Quantization:** Reducing the precision of model weights and activations to decrease model size and improve inference speed.
* **Pruning:** Removing redundant or unnecessary model connections to make the model more efficient.
* **Knowledge Distillation:** Transferring knowledge from large models to smaller ones for improved performance with lower resource usage.

## Examples
Our optimization technique has been successfully applied to various ML models and use cases, including:
* **Image Classification:** Achieved faster inference on mobile and embedded devices.
* **Object Detection:** Optimized performance for real-time applications on edge devices.
* **Natural Language Processing:** Reduced latency and memory usage for deploying models in resource-constrained environments.
